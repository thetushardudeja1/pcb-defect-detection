    "## Dataset Overview (DeepPCB)\n",
    "\n",
    "The DeepPCB dataset is a publicly available benchmark dataset designed for\n",
    "printed circuit board (PCB) defect analysis. It contains high-resolution PCB\n",
    "images along with defect annotations that indicate the location and type of\n",
    "manufacturing defects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each PCB image is accompanied by an annotation file containing bounding box\n",
    "coordinates and a defect class label. A single PCB image may contain multiple\n",
    "defects, and each defect is treated as an independent sample by cropping the\n",
    "corresponding region using the provided bounding box.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, the dataset is converted into a patch-based classification\n",
    "problem. Defect regions are cropped from the original PCB images using bounding\n",
    "boxes, resized to a fixed resolution, and used as inputs to a convolutional\n",
    "neural network. This approach allows the model to focus on local defect patterns\n",
    "instead of processing the entire PCB image.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset includes six classes:\n",
    "Open, Short, Crack, Missing Hole, Spur, and Background. Class labels are mapped\n",
    "to integer indices for model training.\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure consistency between data inspection and training, the same dataset\n",
    "loader and preprocessing pipeline are reused across notebooks. Data augmentation\n",
    "is applied only during training to improve robustness to orientation and\n",
    "appearance variations, while validation data remains unaltered to provide a\n",
    "fair evaluation of model generalization.\n"
